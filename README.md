# Algorithms-for-DNA-sequencing
## Context
This is the course offered by Johns-Hopkins university I completed on Coursera. It has been one of the toughest courses I have ever taken, which spent a huge amount of time discussing multiple algorithms from the oldest to the latest to sequence genomes. Keys to programming homeworks are all in my notebooks, divided into modules.
